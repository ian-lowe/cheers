## About

I thought it would be fun to see what the [Front End Happy Hour](https://frontendhappyhour.com) podcast would be like if it got a little more wild.
Built with JavaScript, Python/Flask, and utilizing the Listen API to pull podcast data, this application allows you
to interactively participate with the crew!
